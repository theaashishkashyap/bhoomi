Product Name: BHOOMI

(Verified Land Information & Discovery Platform)

1. Product Overview
1.1 Purpose

BHOOMI is a verified land information and discovery platform designed to bring transparency, trust, and efficiency to land utilization by:

Displaying vacant government land available for lease

Displaying private land listings only after government-backed verification

Acting strictly as an information, discovery, and verification facilitator

Explicitly not participating in selling, leasing, negotiation, or transactions

1.2 Legal Positioning (Core Principle)

BHOOMI is not a broker, agent, seller, or intermediary.
It only verifies and displays land-related information using authorized and verifiable data sources.

This legal positioning must be clearly visible:

On the BHOOMI homepage

On every land listing page

During verification flows

Before revealing contact details
